# SplatterPlot
Influenced by this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6484064), as an exercise I generated the eruption time of Old Faithful Spring and the US Gun death contour map based on **Kernel density estimation**.

# Kernel density estimation(KDE)
KDE estimates the probability distribution of a random variable. The kernel’s bandwidth determines the estimate’s smoothness: if the bandwidth is too small, the estimate may include spurious bumps and wiggles; too large, and the estimate reveals little about the underlying distribution.
